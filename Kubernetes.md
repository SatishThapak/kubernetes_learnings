## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### 🔑 Key Concepts of Kubernetes

1. **Container Orchestration**  
   Kubernetes manages containers (like those created by Docker) across multiple hosts, handling scheduling, scaling, and failover.

2. **Declarative Configuration**  
   You define the desired state of your system (e.g., number of replicas, resource limits), and Kubernetes maintains it.

3. **Self-Healing**  
   Automatically replaces failed containers, restarts crashed ones, and kills those that don’t respond to health checks.

4. **Load Balancing & Service Discovery**  
   Distributes traffic across containers and provides internal DNS for services.

5. **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks**  
   Deploy new versions of applications without downtime and revert if something goes wrong.

6. **Storage Orchestration**  
   Mounts local or cloud storage as needed by containers.

### 🛠️ Why Kubernetes Matters

- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications up or down based on demand.
- **Portability**: Works across public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises environments.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes hardware usage and reduces infrastructure costs.
- **Community & Ecosystem**: Backed by a large community and supported by major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
